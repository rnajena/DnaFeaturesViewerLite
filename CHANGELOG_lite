Only changes on top of the original package are listed here.
We use minor versions to stay compatible with the versioning of the original package.

v3.1.5.1:
  * allow to plot hatches with matplotlib backend
  * fix clipped feature boxes for axes with small height
  * fix AttributeError if first_index option is used
v3.1.5:
  * no changes
v3.1.4:
  * make biopython optional:
    either sugar or biopython can be used for sequence manipulation tasks,
    like translating the sequence to amino acids
  * fix: only distribute main package (issue #94)
